# BeatMe

This is a project where I try to create a chess bot to beat myself at chess. 

I created this project for my own recreational purposes. All thought there are lots of
interesting resources on this topic out on the internet, using ML and on chess 
programming in general, this is just a naive implementation for fun. Eventually I 
might start adapting more sophisticated approaches, but for now it's just a fun project for myself.
Feel free to make suggestions on the code, but no pull requests are accepted at this time :-) 

The project will probably be refactored many times, and is definitely not a go-to resource 
on how to create your own chess bot.

## Tech

The code is written in Clojure. It you haven't installed it already, then do so.
On a Mac just run

`brew install clojure/tools/clojure`

and then run  

`clj -A:test`

to execute the test. For now I'm just starting to implement the gameplay, so there is nothing to
see here unless you want to execute the tests...
